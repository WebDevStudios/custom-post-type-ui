Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies for WordPress

== Description ==

Custom Post Type UI provides an easy to use interface for registering and managing custom post types and taxonomies for your website.

= Custom Post Type UI Extended =

CPTUI helps create custom content types, but displaying that content can be a whole new challenge. We created [Custom Post Type UI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui-desription&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) to help with displaying your crafted content. [View our Layouts page](https://pluginize.com/cpt-ui-extended-features/?utm_source=cptui-description-examples&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) to see available layout examples with Custom Post Type UI Extended.

Beginning with version 1.7.0, Custom Post Type UI Extended has properly moved in to the Block editor experience and is working to get all the layouts available in the new "Custom Post Type UI Block". It's now even easier to start showing your content with the existing and future layouts available with Custom Post Type UI Extended.

[Pluginize](https://pluginize.com/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) was launched in 2016 by [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) to promote, support, and house all of their [WordPress products](https://pluginize.com/shop/?utm_source=cptui-&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). Pluginize is not only [creating new products for WordPress, like CPTUI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg), but also provides ongoing support and development for WordPress community favorites like [CMB2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/) and more.
