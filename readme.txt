Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies for WordPress

== Description ==

Custom Post Type UI provides an easy to use interface for registering and managing custom post types and taxonomies for your website.

While CPTUI helps solve the problem of creating custom post types, displaying the data gleaned from them can be a whole new challenge. Thatâ€™s why we created [Custom Post Type UI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui-desription&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). [View our Layouts page](https://pluginize.com/cpt-ui-extended-features/?utm_source=cptui-description-examples&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) to see some examples that are available with Custom Post Type UI Extended.

Official development of Custom Post Type UI is on GitHub, with official stable releases published on WordPress.org. The GitHub repo can be found at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui). Please use the Support tab for potential bugs, issues, or enhancement ideas.

[Pluginize](https://pluginize.com/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) was launched in 2016 by [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) to promote, support, and house all of their [WordPress products](https://pluginize.com/shop/?utm_source=cptui-&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). Pluginize is not only [creating new products for WordPress all the time, like CPTUI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg), but also provides ongoing support and development for WordPress community favorites like [CMB2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/) and more.
