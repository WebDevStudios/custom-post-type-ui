Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies in WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy to use interface to create and administer custom post types and taxonomies in WordPress.  This plugin is created for WordPress 3.x.

Please note that this plugin will NOT handle display of registered post types or taxonomies in your current theme. It will simply register them for you.

All official development on this plugin is on GitHub. Version bumps will still be published here on WordPress.org. You can find the repo at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui). Please file issues, bugs, and enhancement ideas there, when possible.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create a custom post type
2. Create a custom taxonomy
3. Custom post type and taxonomies are automatically added to your admin menus
4. Easily view and edit existing custom post types.  Even "Get Code" generated by the plugin
5. Custom taxonomies are automatically added to your content type screens

That's it! Now you can easily start creating custom post types and taxonomies in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display content from a custom post type on my website? =

Justin Tadlock has written some great posts on the topic:
[Showing Custom Post Types on your Home Page](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui)
[Custom Post Types in WordPress](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress)

= How can I add custom meta boxes to my custom post types? =

The More Fields plugin does a great job at creating custom meta boxes and fully supports custom post types: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/

= I changed my custom post type name and now I can't get to my posts =

You can either change the custom post type name back to the original name or try the Post Type Switcher plugin here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-type-switcher/

= I receive a 404 error when viewing custom post type content =

This is usually caused if the rewrite slug was changed.  To fix this issue simply visit Settings > Permalinks to flush the rewrite rules in WordPress

= Will this work in previous version of WordPress =

The register_post_type function was added in WordPress 2.9 so technically it should work in 2.9, but there is no admin menu UI so all post types are created and used behind the scenes.
