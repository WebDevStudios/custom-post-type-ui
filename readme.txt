Admin UI for creating custom content types like post types and taxonomies

== Description ==

Custom Post Type UI provides an easy-to-use interface for registering and managing custom post types and taxonomies for your website.

= Custom Post Type UI Extended =

CPTUI helps create custom content types, but displaying that content can be a whole new challenge. [Custom Post Type UI Extended](https://pluginize.com/plugins/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui-desription&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) was created to help with displaying your crafted content. [View our Layouts page](https://pluginize.com/cpt-ui-extended-features/?utm_source=cptui-description-examples&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) to see available layout examples with Custom Post Type UI Extended.
