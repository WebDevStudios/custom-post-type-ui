Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies in WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy to use interface to create and administer custom post types and taxonomies in WordPress.  This plugin is created for WordPress 3.x.

Please note that this plugin will NOT handle display of registered post types or taxonomies in your current theme. It will simply register them for you.

All official development on this plugin is on GitHub. Version bumps will still be published here on WordPress.org. You can find the repo at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui). Please file confirmed issues, bugs, and enhancement ideas there, when possible.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add new post type screen and tab.
2. Edit post type screen and tab.
3. Add new taxonomy screen and tab.
4. Edit taxonomy screen and tab.
5. Registered post types and taxonomies from CPTUI
6. Import/Export screen.
7. Help/support screen.
8. Update Information/Donate screen.
